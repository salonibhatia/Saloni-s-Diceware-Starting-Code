In this new and updated program, I added more loops in this function. I made this program in the very beginning of this year, so it is very rudimentary, but with the skills that I have now, I was able to make it more advanced. What I did was I added a loop inside my function saying which number will change the words. I was able to add more words by adding more variables and the variables value would be the number that I chose from the file. The main part of this program is the variables because without the variables I would not be able to use the words from the wordlist file. This program is now more advanced because it has more loops and it more creative than my first attempt in making this program. Loops is also an integral part of this program because without the loops I would not be able to use different number keys to change the words.
